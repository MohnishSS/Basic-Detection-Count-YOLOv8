# Object-Detection-and-Count

This project was made using OpenCV and YOLO in Python.

It takes 1 image as input.

Outputs the objects it recognizes in the image and the number of those objects.

To use your own image as input,
  
 	Go to line 7 of 'objects-and-count.py'
  
 	Change the filepath of the image

If you want to see the image after it has been processed,
  
  	Go to line 7 of 'objects-and-count.py'
  
  	Change show=False to show=True

Here is an example of the output for 'busy_street.png'
